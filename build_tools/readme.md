# So you wanna make a game?!?

well too bad we gotta setup your environment first

## Godot
Install godot with mono at C:/program files/godot

## setup.ps1
Given that your likely running windows with godot, run this and it will make sure you have env vars setup correctly. But first run this in a _POWERSHELL_ window _AS ADMINISTRATOR_:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```
So we can actually make this shit work
